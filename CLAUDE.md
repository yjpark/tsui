# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tsui is a data-driven, multi-backend GUI environment: a framework that generates
user interfaces from data definitions (with sensible defaults and targeted
overrides), plus a set of general-purpose applications. Multiple GUI backends
(Bevy, Dioxus, gpui, egui, …) plug in beneath a common abstraction, and it
integrates most deeply with moco apps. Tsui is the GUI layer in the
[Kudo](https://github.com/edger-dev/kudo) platform.

## Engineering with kinora: specs · tasks · plans

This repo runs its engineering intent out of **kinora** (the `.kinora/` ledger),
not loose markdown. There is **no `docs/plans/`**. This is the *workflow*;
`kinora <cmd> --help` is the reference. The `kinora` CLI is on `PATH` in the dev
shell (provided by the kinora jig).

### The model

Engineering intent is version-controlled alongside the code. Three roots are
declared in `.kinora/config.styx`, all `policy "never"` (nothing auto-swept):

```
roots {
  specs { policy "never" }   # durable contracts — the source of truth
  tasks { policy "never" }   # the open work + its plan — transient
  inbox { policy "never" }   # findings / rough edges for the tooling itself
}
```

A **kino** is one content-addressed, versioned document with a **stable id**
(identity hash — survives renames and re-versions) and a per-version hash. You
reference one kino from another by **stable id**, never by title; in the body an
`kino://<id>` token renders as a link. Three shapes, one job each:

| Kino | Root | Holds |
|------|------|-------|
| **spec** | `specs` | one atomic contract — a single decision + its rationale (durable) |
| **task** | `tasks` | the goal, the spec ids it realizes, its plan id, the done-when |
| **plan** | `tasks` | the phases of one task + status notes in prose |

**One spec = one atomic contract.** If a spec needs the word *and* to describe
what it covers, split it. A spec states what was chosen, what was rejected and
why, and the escape hatch. `kinora resolve "<name>"` / `kinora resolve <id>`
prints one kino; `kinora render` builds the whole ledger into an mdbook.

### The iron rule: render reads *committed* state

`kinora render` and `kinora resolve` read git-**committed** `.kinora/` state, not
the working tree. The full loop for any kino change is always:

```
kinora store …      # write the new kino version into the ledger (staged)
kinora commit       # fold the declared roots into a kinora commit  (main only)
git commit          # (or at least `git add .kinora`) — now it's real
kinora render       # optional: rebuild the mdbook from committed state
```

Skipping `git commit` is the most common mistake. If a render looks stale, you
forgot it.

### Concurrent worktrees: stage on the branch, `kinora commit` only on `main`

kinora has no ledger merge yet. `store`/`assign` write only additive, hash-named
files under `.kinora/staged/` and `.kinora/store/` (union-merge, zero conflict);
only `commit` touches `roots/*`. So in a feature branch: **stage, never commit**
— `kinora store …` then `git commit` the staged files (no `kinora commit` on a
branch). **Promote on `main`**: after the branch merges, run a single
`kinora commit` on `main`, then `git commit` the `.kinora` change. A staged id is
content-derived and stable, so it is valid for a `kino://`/`// implements:` ref
immediately and survives promotion.

### Bracket every code change with spec + task maintenance — before *and* after

**Before coding:** identify the spec(s) the change realizes and the open task
that tracks it. If none exists, **write the atomic spec kino + the task/plan kino
first** — intent leads the work.

**After coding:** reconcile intent with what you built — re-version the affected
spec if behavior changed and fix any drifted `// implements:` ref; update the
plan kino's status note; when the task is done mark **both the task and the plan**
`-m status::resolved=true`; then `kinora commit` (on main) → `git commit`.

### Writing code (TDD), linked to intent

1. Write tests **first** that capture the spec; confirm they fail for the right
   reason (assertion/behavior, not a missing type).
2. Implement the minimum to pass. Whole suite green; linter clean (zero warnings).
3. **Link code back to intent** — each module/fn that realizes a spec cites it:
   ```
   // implements: <spec-id>@<version>   (strong — this code fulfils that contract)
   // task: <task-id>@<version>         (weak — audit trail to the work item)
   ```
   Get `<version>` from `kinora resolve` (at v1 the version equals the id). When a
   spec is re-versioned and its behavior changed, grep its `// implements:` refs
   and bump the version so the link doesn't silently drift.

### Commit cadence per phase

1. **tests** commit
2. **implementation** commit (code + warning fixes)
3. **review-fixes** commit (if any) — after the impl commit, code-review the last
   1–2 commits (prefer a fresh subagent) and fix in a separate commit.

As a phase finishes, update the plan kino's status note (re-store → `kinora
commit` on main → `git commit`). A task is **done** when: tests pass, warnings
are zero, the spec kinos are satisfied, the plan notes mark its phases done, both
the task and plan kinos are `-m status::resolved=true`, and everything —
including `.kinora` — is committed.

### Re-versioning (the mechanics)

```
kinora store <kind> <path> --id <stable-id> --parents <prev-head-hash>
#            ^ markdown|text|…   ^ pin identity   ^ current head
```

- A bare re-version with no `--root` inherits the kino's existing root (not swept
  to inbox). **Re-pass `--name` and any `-m` metadata** — metadata is per-version,
  not inherited.
- Re-versioning an already-committed kino resolves to a single head (no fork).
- A re-version with *identical bytes* may be rejected as a same-bytes self-parent
  — change something real, or set metadata in the same store as a content change.
- Merge a stray two-head fork with `--parents <newhead>,<oldhead>`.

### Cross-referencing

A task lists the **spec ids** it realizes and its **plan id**; a plan back-links
its **task id** — always by stable id (`kino://<id>`). The **inbox** root is for
findings/rough edges about the tooling itself, one kino per finding, so they feed
back into the backlog.

### TL;DR checklist

- [ ] Before code: the spec(s) and task/plan exist. If not, write them **first**.
- [ ] Tests first, from the spec. Fail for the right reason.
- [ ] Minimum code to pass. Zero warnings.
- [ ] `// implements: <spec-id>@<ver>` on the code that realizes a spec.
- [ ] After code: re-version drifted specs; fix drifted refs; update the plan note.
- [ ] Per phase: tests commit → impl commit → review-fixes commit.
- [ ] Task done: both task **and** plan `-m status::resolved=true`.
- [ ] Every kino change: `kinora store` → `kinora commit` (main) → `git commit` `.kinora`.
